 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The engineering requires some skills that should be emphasized, among them the following: teamwork, data analysis, real problem solving. The active learning methodologies have as objective to fill these gaps that the job market demands of the students, among them we have the Team-Based Learning (TBL) that is a collaborative learning methodology. Although there are tools to support the use of TBL with Computer-Mediated Communication (CMCs), the literature does not deal with tools to automate the implementation and implementation of TBL in the academic environment. The goal of this work is the implementation of a tool called PGTBL to automate the process of using the active learning methodology. The development methodology used to achieve the objectives was an adaptation to SCRUM, XP and SAFe for a team of only one member that will do all the assigned roles in the methodology. The purpose of the software is to make the TBL application easier, more constant and automated, making the process more enjoyable for both the student and the teacher. The idea of the system is to have an attractive design and will be responsible for the entire process of the TBL teaching methodology.
